# Tutorial 1 - Creating an Angular App
### Install Node
Make sure Node is installed on your system. You can download node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Check that node and npm are installed:
```bash
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
### Install Angular CLI
You can install the Angular CLI [here](https://cli.angular.io/).
```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
### Setup Angular Project
You can now create an Angular project with a name of your choice:
```
$ ng new [app-name]
```
Navigate to the project directory and run the developmental server:
```
$ cd [app-name]
$ ng serve
```
The server can be shut down with ```ctrl + c```.

By default the project is viewable at http://localhost:4200/.
